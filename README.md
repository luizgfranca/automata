## How do I run this?

The software is stil in Alpha, so there's no official release yet, exepct bugs and missing features.

Currently you can only run by manually compiling from one of the tagged commits:
 - Go to the tagged version you want
 - Download
 - Run `cargo install` and `cargo build`
 - Copy the executable in `target/release/automata` to your `/usr/bin` folder or add the release folder to your `$PATH`
